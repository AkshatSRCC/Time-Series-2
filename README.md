# Time-Series-2

White Noise : A specific type of time series where data doesn't follow any pattern, there is no auto-correlation between present and past values.
-Random Walk : A random walk is one in which future steps or directions cannot be predicted on the basis of past history.( Relation between any two time periods of Random Walk comes out to be a white noise)
- Stationarity : cov(a) = cov(b) 
 1) constant mean 
 2) constant variance 
 3) consistent covariance between the periods, and identical distance from one another.
# David Dickey and Wayne Fuller test to check the stationarity and non stationarity
- Seasonality : Certain trends will appear on cyclical basis
